## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Convert data types  
   - Extract time-based features (hour, weekday, peak hours)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions  
   - Understand route, delay, and time trends  
   - Check delivery patterns across days and hours  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Delay Percent  
   - Trip Efficiency  
   - Time Slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)  
   - Peak Hour Indicator  
   - On-Time Delivery Flag  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Regression Task  
   - Models used:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest  
     - XGBoost  
     - CatBoost  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used:  
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
     - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)  
     - R² Score  
   - Comparison of model performances using bar plots
